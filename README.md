# Uber Data ANalysis
Objective:

The goal is to conduct exploratory data analysis on the dataset to uncover hidden or previously unknown information. This involves understanding how each field in the dataset influences the 'Price' variable in relation to other fields. Subsequently, various machine learning models are applied to the data to conduct a thorough analysis. The performance of these models is evaluated based on accuracy, and the best-performing model is recommended for future predictions of the 'Price' label.
